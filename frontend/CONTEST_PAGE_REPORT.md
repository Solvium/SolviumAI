## ⚡ Task Page: Multiplier & Power-Ups Enhancement

### Overview
Enhanced the multiplier system in the Task Page to provide better visibility and user experience for deposit-based power-ups.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Dynamic Multiplier Calculation**
- Real-time multiplier calculation based on deposit amount
- Formula: `contractMultiplier × depositAmount`
- Supports decimal amounts for flexible deposits

#### 2. **Multiplier Tiers Display**
```
1 NEAR = 1x multiplier
5 NEAR = 5x multiplier
10 NEAR = 10x multiplier
25 NEAR = 25x multiplier
```

#### 3. **Live Multiplier Preview**
- Shows calculated multiplier as user types deposit amount
- Displays bonus multiplier gain
- Visual feedback with color-coded badges
- Example: "+4.5x bonus" for 5.5 NEAR deposit

#### 4. **Contract Integration**
- Fetches multiplier factor from smart contract
- Tracks multiplier changes before/after deposits
- Auto-refresh functionality with manual refresh button
- Displays current user multiplier prominently

#### 5. **User Feedback**
- Toast notifications for multiplier changes
- Visual indicators for multiplier updates
- Refresh button (🔄) for manual contract sync
- Real-time balance updates

### Technical Details

```typescript
// Multiplier Calculation Function
const calculateMultiplierForAmount = (amount: string) => {
  const numAmount = parseFloat(amount);
  if (isNaN(numAmount) || numAmount <= 0) return 1;
  return currentMultiplier * numAmount;
};

// Multiplier Tracking
const multiplierTracker = await trackDepositMultiplier(nearAmount);
const beforeMultiplier = multiplierTracker.beforeMultiplier;
const multiplierResult = await multiplierTracker.checkAfterDeposit();
```

### User Experience Improvements
✅ Clear multiplier visualization  
✅ Real-time feedback on deposit impact  
✅ Transparent calculation display  
✅ Easy-to-understand tier system  
✅ Manual refresh option for power users
