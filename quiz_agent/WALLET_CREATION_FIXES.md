# Wallet Creation Fixes - Production Ready Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve the sub-account creation issues in production. The main problem was that the system was silently falling back to demo wallets when RPC timeouts occurred, creating invalid wallet addresses that don't exist on the blockchain.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

1. **Silent Fallback**: When RPC calls failed due to timeouts, the system would return `True` from the fallback method, creating "demo" wallets with real-looking account IDs
2. **No Account Verification**: Created accounts were never verified to actually exist on the blockchain
3. **No Retry Logic**: RPC timeouts were not retried with exponential backoff
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Errors were swallowed and users received invalid wallets
5. **No User Communication**: Users weren't informed about delays or failures

### The Impact

- Users received wallet addresses that don't exist on-chain
- When users won rewards, transfers failed because accounts didn't exist
- Poor user experience with no feedback about wallet creation status

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. RPC Retry Logic with Circuit Breaker (`src/utils/rpc_retry.py`)

**Features:**

- **Exponential Backoff**: Configurable retry delays with exponential increase
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures by temporarily disabling failing endpoints
- **Error Classification**: Distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors
- **Configurable Retries**: Environment-based retry configuration

**Configuration:**

```python
RPC_MAX_RETRIES = 3
RPC_RETRY_DELAY = 1.0  # Initial delay in seconds
RPC_MAX_RETRY_DELAY = 10.0  # Max delay in seconds
RPC_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2.0
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT = 60  # seconds
```

### 2. Wallet Creation Queue (`src/services/wallet_creation_queue.py`)

**Features:**

- **Retry Queue**: Failed wallet creations are queued for retry
- **Account Verification**: Verifies accounts exist on blockchain after creation
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses Redis for queue persistence
- **Configurable Retries**: Environment-based retry limits and delays

**Configuration:**

```python
WALLET_CREATION_QUEUE_ENABLED = true
WALLET_CREATION_RETRY_DELAY = 300  # 5 minutes
WALLET_CREATION_MAX_RETRIES = 3
```

### 3. Fixed Fallback Method (`src/services/near_wallet_service.py`)

**Key Changes:**

- **Never Returns True on Failure**: Fallback method now properly propagates errors
- **Account Verification**: All created accounts are verified to exist on blockchain
- **Proper Error Propagation**: Uses custom `WalletCreationError` exceptions
- **Retry Integration**: All RPC calls use the new retry logic

**Before (Problematic):**

```python
# Final fallback: Demo sub-account
logger.info(f"All real creation methods failed, using demo sub-account: {sub_account_id}")
return True  # ← THIS WAS THE PROBLEM!
```

**After (Fixed):**

```python
# If we reach here, all methods failed
raise WalletCreationError("All account creation methods failed", RPCErrorType.UNKNOWN, True)
```

### 4. Account Verification (`src/services/near_wallet_service.py`)

**New Method:**

```python
async def verify_account_exists(self, account_id: str, network: str = "testnet") -> bool:
    """Verify that an account exists on the blockchain"""
```

**Features:**

- **RPC Verification**: Uses NEAR RPC to check account existence
- **Retry Logic**: Includes retry logic for verification calls
- **Error Handling**: Proper error classification and handling

### 5. User Notification Service (`src/services/user_notification_service.py`)

**Features:**

- **Delay Notifications**: Informs users when wallet creation is delayed
- **Success Notifications**: Confirms successful wallet creation
- **Failure Notifications**: Explains failures and retry attempts
- **Retry Updates**: Keeps users informed about retry progress

**Notification Types:**

- `notify_wallet_creation_delay()`: Initial delay notification
- `notify_wallet_creation_success()`: Success confirmation
- `notify_wallet_creation_failure()`: Failure explanation
- `notify_wallet_creation_retry()`: Retry attempt updates

### 6. Background Task Service (`src/services/background_tasks.py`)

**Features:**

- **Queue Processing**: Automatically processes wallet creation queue
- **Task Management**: Manages background tasks lifecycle
- **Monitoring**: Provides task status and health monitoring
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on service shutdown

### 7. Enhanced Configuration (`src/utils/config.py`)

**New Configuration Options:**

```python
# RPC Retry Configuration
RPC_MAX_RETRIES = 3
RPC_RETRY_DELAY = 1.0
RPC_MAX_RETRY_DELAY = 10.0
RPC_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2.0

# Circuit Breaker Configuration
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT = 60

# Account Verification Configuration
ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT = 15
ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION_RETRIES = 2

# Wallet Creation Queue Configuration
WALLET_CREATION_QUEUE_ENABLED = true
WALLET_CREATION_RETRY_DELAY = 300
WALLET_CREATION_MAX_RETRIES = 3
```

## Production Deployment Guide

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your production environment:

```bash
# RPC Retry Configuration
RPC_MAX_RETRIES=3
RPC_RETRY_DELAY=1.0
RPC_MAX_RETRY_DELAY=10.0
RPC_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER=2.0

# Circuit Breaker Configuration
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=60

# Account Verification Configuration
ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT=15
ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION_RETRIES=2

# Wallet Creation Queue Configuration
WALLET_CREATION_QUEUE_ENABLED=true
WALLET_CREATION_RETRY_DELAY=300
WALLET_CREATION_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

### 2. Service Integration

**Initialize Background Tasks:**

```python
from services.background_tasks import background_task_service

# In your main application startup
await background_task_service.start()
```

**Initialize Notification Service:**

```python
from services.user_notification_service import initialize_notification_service

# In your bot initialization
initialize_notification_service(bot)
```

### 3. Error Handling in Bot Handlers

**Updated Error Handling:**

```python
try:
    wallet_info = await wallet_service.create_demo_wallet(user_id, user_name)
    # Send success message
except WalletCreationError as e:
    if e.retryable:
        # Notify user about delay and retry
        await user_notification_service.notify_wallet_creation_delay(
            user_id, account_id, network, estimated_delay=5
        )
    else:
        # Notify user about permanent failure
        await user_notification_service.notify_wallet_creation_failure(
            user_id, account_id, e.message, network
        )
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Logging

**Enhanced Logging:**

- RPC retry attempts and failures
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Wallet creation queue statistics
- Account verification results

### 2. Metrics

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**

- Wallet creation success rate
- RPC timeout frequency
- Circuit breaker activation rate
- Queue processing latency
- Account verification success rate

### 3. Health Checks

**Queue Status:**

```python
stats = await wallet_creation_queue.get_queue_stats()
# Returns: {"pending": 0, "completed": 0, "failed": 0}
```

**Background Task Status:**

```python
status = await background_task_service.get_status()
# Returns task status and health information
```

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests

Test the new retry logic and error handling:

```python
# Test RPC retry with mock failures
# Test circuit breaker activation
# Test account verification
# Test queue processing
```

### 2. Integration Tests

Test the complete wallet creation flow:

```python
# Test successful wallet creation
# Test RPC timeout handling
# Test retry queue functionality
# Test user notifications
```

### 3. Load Testing

Test under high load:

- Multiple concurrent wallet creations
- RPC endpoint failures
- Queue processing under load

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can quickly rollback by:

1. **Disable Queue Processing:**

   ```bash
   WALLET_CREATION_QUEUE_ENABLED=false
   ```

2. **Increase Timeouts:**

   ```bash
   ACCOUNT_CREATION_TIMEOUT=60
   RPC_MAX_RETRIES=1
   ```

3. **Disable Circuit Breaker:**
   ```bash
   CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=1000
   ```

## Benefits
